We stayed at Dirgahayu Hotel which is not far from Malioboro.\r\nOn Thursday, we visited the temples in Prambanan. There are three big temples, the Brahmana, Syiwa and Wisnu temples. They are really amazing. We visited only Brahmana and Syiwa temples, because Wisnu temple is being renovated.\r\nOn Friday morning we went to Yogya Kraton. We spent about two hours there. We were lucky because we were led by a smart and friendly guide. Then we continued our journey to Borobudur.

It was my first time to go to such a ceremony. We gathered there with our kin in the ceremony.\r\nOverall, the ceremony was quite elaborate. It took about a week. Several days before the ceremony was done, grandpa’s body was kept in a series of houses arranged in a circular row around an open field called tongkonan. His corpse was dressed in a fine wearing.\r\nThe funeral was performed in two phases. First, we slaughtered the pigs and buffaloes, and then moved the corpse to face north. In this ceremony we wore black clothes. After that, the corpse was placed in a sandal wood coffin. Then, it was brought out of the house and placed on an open platform beneath the granary. \r\nMeanwhile, my uncle, my brother, and I prepared the wooden puppet and a funeral tower called lakian. The next phase of the ceremony was held in this place. The coffin is borne from the house and placed in the lakian. During the day, there were also buffalo matches. They were great matches.

There were only a few villages. If the people wanted to go from one village to another, they often had to pass through wild and unsafe forest. \r\nOne day, a farmer’s young wife went to the next village to visit her own mother and brother. She brought along her baby son. When it was time for her to leave, her brother said “ it is getting dark. Let my son, Ah Tim go with you though the forest.” \r\nSo Ah Tim led the way and the young woman followed behind, carrying her baby. When they were in the forest, suddenly they saw a group of wolves. They began to run to avoid the danger, but Ah Tim kicked against a stone and fell down. At once the wolves caught him. The young woman cried to the wolves, “ please eat my own son instead.” Then, she put her baby son on the ground in front of the wolves and took her nephew away. \r\nEveryone understood that this was because the woman was very good and kind. She had offered her own son’s life to save her nephew. \r\nThey ran back to the house and called for help. All men in the village fetched thick sticks and went back with her into the forest.

There was no another parrot like it. It was very, very smart. This parrot would say any word-except one. He would not say the name of the town where he was born. The name of the town was Catano.\r\nThe man tried to teach the parrot to say Catano. But the bird would not say the word. At first the man was very nice, but then he got angry. “You are a stupid bird! Why can’t you say the word? Sat Catano, or I will kill you!” but the parrot would not say it. Then the man got to so angry that the shouted over and over, “Say Catano, or I’ll kill you!” but the bird would not talk.\r\nOne day after trying for many hours to make the bird say Catano, the man got very angry. He picked up the bird and threw him into the chicken house. “You are more stupid than the chickens. Soon I will eat them, and I will eat you, too.”\r\nIn the chicken house there are four old chickens. They were for Sunday’s dinner.

He lived in a simple hut in a farming field. He did some gardening and fishing for his daily life.\r\nOne day, while the man was do fishing, he caught a big golden fish in his trap. It was the biggest catch which he ever had in his life. Surprisingly, this fish turned into a beautiful princess. He felt in love with her and proposed her to be his wife.

One day, his daughter was so hungry and she ate his father’s lunch. Unfortunately, he found out and got furious, and shouted; “You damned daughter of a fish”. The daughter ran home and asked her mother. The mother started crying, felt sad that her husband had broken his promise.\r\nThen she told her daughter to run up the hills because a huge disaster was about to come. When her daughter left, she prayed. Soon there was a big earthquake followed by non-stop pouring rain. The whole area got flooded and became Toba Lake.

He picked it up, took it home and looked after it lovingly, even though his wife complained bitterly about his wasting too much time on the creature.\r\nAfter some time, the wing mended and, because the bird did not want the farmer to have kept on arguing with his wife all the time, it decided to go back to its nest.\r\nWhen the farmer discovered that the bird was gone, he was so upset that he went out to look for it. Eventually, he found it again,  and was greeted happily by the whole family of the bird. As a sign of their thanks for his care and attention, the birds gave him a little box, and told him not to open it until he got home.\r\nTo his surprise, the farmer found the box full of precious stones. When his wife saw them, she decided that she too deserved a reward, and she went to see the birds. The birds gave her a little casket; but this one was full of devils. The devils jumped on her as soon as she opened the casket and chased her away.\r\nLeft alone, the farmer went to live near his friend, the bird. There he built a hut of perfumed wood; and the birds decorated it with flowers of every kind.',117),(118,11,'Text 8 for questions36 to 40\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, there lived a group mice under a tree in peace. However, a group of elephants crossing the jungle unknowingly destroyed the homes of all the rats. Many of them were crushed to death.\r\nThen the king of rats decided to approach the elephant’s chief and request him to guide his herd through another route. On hearing the sad story, the elephant’s king apologized and agreed to take another route. And so the lives the rats were saved.\r\nOne day elephant hunters came to the jungle and tripped a group of elephants in huge nets. Then the elephant king suddenly remembered the king of rats. He summoned one of the elephant of his herd which had not been trapped, to go seek help from the king and told him about the trapped elephants.\r\nThe rat’s king immediately took his entire group of rats and they cut the nets which had trapped the elephant’s herd.

This prevents young people from enjoying an active, energetic and adventurous pastime.\r\n\r\nJust watch a local street for a short while and note the steady stream of skaters speeding up and down the footpaths. Toddlers can be trampled on and old ladies can be knocked down as they struggle home carrying their cat food from supermarkets.\r\n\r\nSkateboarding is a serious sport that improves young people’s health. It increases fitness, improves balance and strengthens the joints in knees and ankles. Although it appears to be a solo sport, when groups practice together and compete to perform stunts or runs they form firm friendships.\r\n\r\nYoung people should be prevented from becoming overweight couch potatoes. If they are actively involved in skating, they do not smoke, take drugs or break laws for fun.\r\n\r\nKids will always seek thrills and excitement. They need to practice their 180s, 360s and Ollie’s free from restrictions. We must build skate parks in the suburbs so that streets are safe for small children and senior citizens and skaters have spaces where they can race, chase, speed, and soar towards the sun.',120),(121,9,'Read the following text to answer questions number 6 to 10.\r\nShould Americans be forced to Public Transportation?\r\n\r\nFirst, let me define what the question is and isn’t asking. It isn’t asking if we should we all abandon cars right now, nor is it asking if we should abandon them completely, nor is it asking if every American should do so. It is asking weather some Americans should have to take public transit some of the time, and I would say yes.\r\n\r\nOil use and pollution aside, in some cities like Los Angeles and New York there just isn’t room for any more roads, so in order for large cities to grow, they need more people to take public transit or risk permanent traffic jam. One bus can safely hold 40 people so even at half capacity that’s nearly 20 cars’ worth of space in traffic cleared up, and nearly 20 parking spaces that  don’t need to built.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people that can take  with transit little inconvenience but simply don’t because they never have in the past. If residents in areas with plenty of transit had to buy transit passes as part of their property taxes then they would have little excuse not to bus occasionally. QA number of universities already bundle a ‘U-Pass’ with their tuition feeds, forcing their students to take the bus. When given the change the majority of those students have voted to keep these programs.\r\n\r\nA similar system in apartments where a portion of the tenants are not issued parking spaces in exchange for a discount on their rent would also be community car to several apartment tenants that arrange a schedule for the car, and this program gets many positive reviews.\r\n\r\nSo yes, I would say that Americans should be forced to use public transit, as Americans whom are already forced to do so find that it works well for them.',121),(122,9,'text 3 for questuin 11 to 15\r\n\r\nAnybody who is over the age of six knows that there is nowhere safe for skateboarders to skate.

All of these levels of government are necessary. This is so for number of reasons. First, the federal government is necessary for the big things. They keep the economy in order and look after like defensE. Similarly, the state governments look after the middle sized things. For example they look after law and order, preventing things like vandalism in school. Finally, local government look after the small thins. They look after things like collecting rubbish, otherwise everyone would have diseasE. Thus for the reason above, we can conclude that the three levels of the government are necessary.',123),(124,12,'Analytical Text 2\r\n\r\nThere is no best way to deal with pests in agriculturE. Pesticides which are commonly used may cause many problems. I think combining different management operations is the most effective way to control pests.\r\nFirstly, the chemicals in the pesticides may build up as residues in the environment and in the soil which absorbs the chemicals. This reduces the quality of farm product.\r\nSecondly, pests can gradually become resistant to pesticides. This means that newer and stronger ones have to be developed.\r\nLastly, some pesticides affect non target plants and animals such as fish and bees. This affects the ecology and environment as well.\r\nSo, understanding of ecology of an area helps a lot in pest control. Pesticides should be chosen and applied carefully so that they don’t affect the ecological balance and environment.\r\nTherefore, integrated pest management is a safe and more effective option to fight pest in agriculture and livestock.',124),(125,12,'Analytical Text 3\r\n\r\nAs we all know, cars create pollution, and cause a lot of road deaths and other accidents.\r\nFirstly, cars, as we all know contribute the most of pollution in the world. Cars emit a deadly gas causes illnesses such as bronchitis, lung cancer, and trigger of asthmA. Some of these illness are so bad that people can die from them.\r\nSecondly, the city is very busy. Pedestrians wander every where and cars commonly hit pedestrians in the city, which causes them to diE. Cars today are our roads biggest killers.\r\nThirdly, cars are very noisy. If you live in the city, you may find it hard to sleep at night, or concentrate in your homework, and especially talk to someonE.\r\nIn conclusion, cars should be banned from the city for the reasons listed.',125),(126,12,'Analytical Text 4\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that mobile phones are necessary. My reasons for this belief are that these phones are convenient for business people who travel a lot, and they are handy for emergencies.\r\nTo begin with, mobile phones are necessary in the case of emergencies. For instance, if you fall down a set of stairs in a building and are badly injured and can’t reach a pay phone, it is handy to have one to use. Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighbourhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth.\r\nMy other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can’t stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of every day life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium.',126),(127,12,'Analytical Text 5\r\n\r\nEverybody should change their way of life to reduce global warming. There are several things that we can do. One of them is by buying and consuming fresh local groceries as much as possiblE. It of course includes local vegetables, fruits, bread, etC.\r\nLocal groceries don’t need much transportation to get it into the market. It of course means, the amount of carbon dioxide produced is less than the groceries from other region. Therefore, by buying local groceries we are helping reduce the amount of carbon dioxide produceD.\r\nConsuming fresh groceries instead of frozen ones are healthier for us. Furthermore, fresh food or groceries means no requirements for it to be freeze up. It means that no electricity is needed and saving energy means reducing carbon dioxide and money.\r\nSo, from now on we should consume fresh local groceries to reduce global warming.',127),(128,12,'Analytical Text 6\r\n\r\nThe use of formalin and other dangerous preservatives in food has been serious problem for three reasons. Firstly, formalin is not for human beings, but it is for biological specimens and experiments. Formalin in Biology is a 10% solution of formaldehyde in water which is usually used as a disinfectant or to preserve biological specimens. Thus, it is not for food preservatives. Of course when it is used for food preservative, it will be very dangerous to human’s body.\r\nThe second reason is that there is no tight control from the government. This condition makes the people’s health is really in a threat. When the control is weak and the use formalin was spread wide all over the Indonesian regions, and these days it has really happened, the citizen’s bodies will be badly contaminated with the poisons. Fish or food traders still sell their products which contain formalin and dangerous preservatives. Can you imagine that our digestive system absorbs the substance that should be for the human and animal corpses?\r\nConsidering the reasons, we can make a conclusion that the use of formalin and other preservatives is really a serious problem if it is not resolved immediately.',128),(129,12,'Analytical Text 6\r\n\r\nI personally think that reading is a very important activity in our life. Why do I say so? Firstly, by reading we can get a lot of knowledge about many things in the world such as Science, technology. Sports, arts, culture, etc written in either books, magazine, newspaper, etc.\r\nSecondly, by reading we can get a lot of news and information about something happening in any parts of the world which can we see directly.\r\nAnother reason, reading can give us pleasure too. When we are tired, we read books, newspaper or magazine on the entertainment coloumn such as comedy, short story, quiz, etC. To make us relaxeD.\r\nThe last, reading can also take us to other parts of the worlD. By reading a book about Irian Jaya we may feel we’re really sitting in the jungles not at home in our rooms.\r\nFrom the facts above, it’s obvious that everyone needs to read to get knowledge, information and also entertainment. Or in summary we can say reading is truly important in our lifE.',129),(130,12,'Analytical Text 7\r\n\r\nLearning English through music and songs can be very enjoyablE. You can mix pleasure with learning when you listen to a song and exploit the song as a means to your English progress. Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning.\r\nFirstly, “the song stuck in my head” Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory.\r\nSecondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary samplE.\r\nFurthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purposE. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time referencE.\r\nIn addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution.\r\nLast but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culturE.\r\nFrom the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun.',130),(131,12,'Analytical Text 8\r\n\r\nSmoking in restaurants is just not disturbing. It must not be allowed because it is rude, harmful to others and dangerous for the smokers.\r\nFirstly, smoking in a restaurant is impolitE. The smell of the smoke affects all people and can turn them off their fooD. People pay to taste good food and not to be put off by foul smelling smokE.\r\nAnother reason smoking should not be allowed in restaurant is the harm it can do to others. Passive smoking that is breathing in smoke made by a smoker can lead to asthma attacks and even cancer.\r\nFinally, smoking is dangerous and a health risk to the smokers. Cigarettes cause heart and lung disease and people should not smoke anywhere, not just in restaurants.\r\nTherefore, smoking in restaurants is impolite, harmful to others and a health risk to the smokers and should not be allowed in any restaurants.',131),(132,12,'Analytical Text 9\r\n\r\nTo improve comfort and cleanliness at our school, a number of dust bins should be increased.\r\nWhen we look at classrooms, school corridors and school yard, there are paper mineral water cups, straws, and napkins here and therE. The condition of uncleanliness and discomfort really hinders learning and teaching environment. Litters thrown carelessly cause disease, especially empty plastic cup or glasses. They can be filled out with water coming from the rain. This can be placed for dengue mosquitoes to spread out. Besides, these rubbish can deteriorate the scenE. Well painted wall and green school yard do not mean anything litters are scattered everywherE.\r\nAnyway I notice that most of the students in our school have responsibilities for the school environment. They put their litters on the proper places. But some are not diligent enough to find the dust bins. The numbers of dust binds in our schools are not enough. Ore dust bins should be put beside each of steps, outside of the classrooms, and some more also the corridors. Probably one dust bin should be in every ten meters. So when students want to throw away their litters, they can find the dust bins easily.\r\nWhen school is equipped with sufficient dust bins, we do not have problems of freak and discomfort any morE. Our school will be very clean and become a nice place to study.',132),(133,12,'Analytical Text 10\r\n\r\nSchool uniform is special clothes worn by all students of a particular school. The uniform of a school may differ from others. Why should schools use uniforms? Below are some reasons.\r\nFirst of all, Notre Dame’s Department of Sociology produced a study in 1998 concerning school uniforms. Their findings using 10th grade students showed that uniforms have no direct effect on “substance abuse, behavioral problems or attendancE.” It also claimed a negative effect on student achievements for those students considered ‘pro-school’.\r\nSecondly, uniform helps to create a strong sense school ethos and a sense of belonging to a particular community. As such it promotes discipline and helps to drive up academic standards, which is why a uniform is often adopted by schools which are being reopened with a fresh start after being classified as failing.\r\nFinally, uniform acts as a social leveler, under which all students are equal in the eyes of the school and of each other. In institutions without uniform students are often competitive and worry endlessly about their appearance and the clothes they should wear. Pupils without expensive designer clothes and trainers may be singled out as social outcasts, or stigmatized as being from poor backgrounds. For these reasons many parents prefer uniforms as they save them money on buying clothes for school wear. Considering the findings, schools should implement the uniform as their identity. The government should also publish some kind of rule which makes uniform compulsory for schools.',133);
